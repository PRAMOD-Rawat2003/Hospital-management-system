Each table is created with thoughtful references to maintain data integrity and avoid redundancies.

2. Benefits of Our Modeling Approach:
Scalability: Easily accommodates future expansions and updates.
Efficiency: Optimized queries ensure fast and reliable data retrieval.
Data Integrity: Robust foreign key constraints maintain accuracy and consistency.

3. Complex Query Capabilities:
Retrieve all patients assigned to a specific doctor along with their room details.
List patients who have been admitted more than once.
Calculate the average age of patients in each room type.
Retrieve treatments provided by a specific doctor within the last month.
